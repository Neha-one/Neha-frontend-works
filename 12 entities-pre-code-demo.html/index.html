            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a premier nationwide initiative designed to engage students in solving
                some of the most pressing challenges faced in everyday life. Launched to foster a culture of innovation
                and practical problem-solving, SIH provides a dynamic platform for students to develop and showcase
                their creative solutions to real-world problems. By encouraging participants to think critically and
                innovatively, the hackathon aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application.

                Since its inception, SIH has garnered significant success in promoting out-of-the-box thinking among
                young minds, particularly engineering students from across India. Each edition has built on the previous
                one, refining its approach and expanding its impact. The hackathon not only offers students an
                opportunity to showcase their skills but also encourages collaboration with industry experts, government
                agencies, and other stakeholders.</p>
